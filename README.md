# NaviHealth
New Repo for starting project called Navi Health

#Project Definition
The goal of this project is to improve access to and understanding of British Columbia’s healthcare system for immigrant senior citizens whose primary language is neither English nor French. By combining machine translation with human-in-the-loop verification, the project aims to deliver accurate, trustworthy, and easy-to-use translated healthcare documents, enabling seniors to navigate healthcare services with greater independence, confidence, and safety.

#Project Goal/Outcome
This project will design and deploy a user-friendly mobile and web application tailored to the needs of immigrant seniors in British Columbia. The application will allow users to upload or capture healthcare-related documents (e.g., medical forms, appointment letters, consent forms) and view side-by-side translations: the original English text alongside a machine-translated version in the user’s preferred language.

To ensure accuracy and trust, the application will incorporate a human verification workflow. Family members—such as sons and daughters who already assist seniors with understanding healthcare forms—will be invited to review and approve translations. Their feedback will serve as a quality assurance mechanism and a training signal to continuously improve the underlying AI translation models.

The system will be designed with accessibility and simplicity as core principles, recognizing that many seniors face challenges with complex or unintuitive technology. The project will leverage existing technical and business expertise to ensure scalability, privacy compliance, and alignment with provincial healthcare standards.
