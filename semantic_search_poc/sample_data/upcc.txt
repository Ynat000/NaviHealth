Urgent and primary care centres (UPCCs) provide access to same-day, urgent, non-emergency health care. UPCCs are often open evenings, weekends and statutory holidays (actual hours vary by clinic). 
UPCCs are an alternative to visiting the hospital for issues that don’t require emergency care.
Patients who require medical attention within 12 to 24 hours can receive care at UPCCs for conditions such as:
High fevers
Sprains and strains caused by minor accidents and falls
Minor bleeding or cuts that require stitches
Minor burns that may require care
Mild to moderate breathing difficulty or asthma attacks
Sinus, oral or lung infections
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation
Skin conditions such as rashes or infections
Minor allergic reactions
Pain or burning when urinating
Non-severe new or worsening pain
New or worsening mental health concerns
This list is not exhaustive, and whether a UPCC is appropriate will depend on your specific situation. Always prioritize your health and safety.
