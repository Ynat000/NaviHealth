Walk-in clinics provide access to non-urgent medical care for people who need health advice, assessment and or treatment for minor illness and injuries.  
Walk-in clinics deal with various health problems and are often open in the evenings and weekends. Usually, you do not need an appointment or you can get an appointment that same day.
